# A Countdown Timer

### See it in action [here](https://charyung.github.io/countdown-timer/)!

A countdown timer component I made for my previous work term (don't worry, I asked for permission to share this). It was originally just the flip clock timer; The controls were added for this project for the sake of demoing.
